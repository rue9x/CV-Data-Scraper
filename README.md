# CV-Data-Scraper
A webscraper for pulling Castlevania Symphony of the Night enemy data from Deixadilson

Installation:
- Requires Python 3.5 or above
- pip install html2text
- Download crawl.py
- Create c:\code\
- py crawl.py
- Navigate to c:\code\ and enjoy your giant pile of text files.

Why?
- I couldn't find anyone on the web who had STR/DEF data for enemies in SOTN, and I needed it for a project.
